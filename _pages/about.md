I am a PhD student at University of Zurich, supervised by professor [Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it) and the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group. My research interests lie in the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) on distributed software systems and databases and I obtained my M.Eng. degree from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece](https://www.auth.gr/en/).
