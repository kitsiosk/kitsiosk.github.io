I am a Ph.D. student at University of Zurich, supervised by professor [Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it) and the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group. My research interests lie at the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. Specifically, I focus on the development of deep learning models, datasets and evaluation methods for software engineering downstream tasks like code clone detection, pull request automation, commit untangling and more.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) on distributed software systems and databases and I obtained my M.Eng. degree from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece](https://ece.auth.gr/en/home/).

When I'm not doing research, I spend my time playing (beach) volleyball, chess, and music (bouzouki/guitar). Reading fantasy literature is another thing I'm passionate about, especially J.R.R. Tolkien.
