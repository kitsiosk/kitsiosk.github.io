I am a Ph.D. student at the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/de.html), supervised by Prof. [Alberto Bacchelli](https://sback.it) and the [ZEST](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/zest.html) group since September 2023. 
My research focuses on software testing, particularly fuzzing, search-based software testing, and AI for testing, though I also enjoy working on the broader software engineering research landscape.
My research is also supported by the [Bodossaki Foundation](https://www.bodossaki.gr).

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com) on distributed software systems and databases, and I obtained my M.Eng. from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece](https://ece.auth.gr/en/home/).

When I'm not doing research, I spend my time playing (beach) volleyball, chess, and music (bouzouki/guitar).
